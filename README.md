FBPhotoBox
==========

A Jquery plugin to generate a facebook like photo viewing box intended to provide following functionalities:

1. A content area on the right side where can place details about the photo e.g. user, tagged people, comments
2. Fullscreen mode
3. Adding photo tagging box by providing the tag area information by client
4. Hope to have a better UX for people browsing the album
5. Responsive with option to set the minimum box size

This plugin is just finished the core part.
Please give a try and giving feedbacks to me, as this is my first personal project : )
